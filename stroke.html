<h2>
The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons:
</h2>
<h3>The History of the Human Brain as Revealed by True Stories of Trauma, Madness and Recovery</h3>
<h3>By Sam Kean</h3>
<p>Great read! It combines neuroscience with important historical context and funny anecdotes.</p>

		<h2>Total Anterior Circulation Infarct</h2>
			<p>A type of stroke affecting the entire anterior circulation supplying one side of the brain.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h3>Symptoms</h3>
				<p>Sudden onset. Maximal intensity reached within 24 hours.
Focal symptoms include cognitive impairment, dysphasia, visuospatial disturbances, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonymous_hemianopsia">homonymous hemianopia</a> and motor and sensory defects in the face, arm and legs.
Global symptoms are headache, altered mental status, syncope, seizure and coma.
</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h3>Prognosis and Duration</h3>
				<p>TACI is an acute condition with long-term consequences that may include death.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h3>Cause</h3>
				<p>Occlusion of one of the major intracranial arteries or one of the small single penetrator arteries. Blockages can be emboli caused by atherosclerosis or atheroma (degeneration fo the walls of the arteries caused by accumulated fatty deposits and scar tissue). Cerebral blood flow rates of less than 20ml/100g/min may also produce infarction. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h3>Demographics</h3>
				<p>TACIs make up 70% of ischemic strokes. African Americans, followed by Hispanic and Asian Americans, suffer from a risk of stroke at up to four times that of Caucasians. Men and Eastern Europeans are also at increased risk. Incidence rises exponentially in people over 55, but 25% of strokes occur in those younger than 65. Genetic risk factors include heart disease and <a href="#">CADASIL</a>, and modifiable risk factors include hypertension, Type I Diabetes, atrial fibrillation, smoking, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, alcohol abuse, drug use, oral contraceptive use in women, and pregnancy.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
				<p>Lab tests are necessary to find the underlying cause. This can include a coagulation profile, glucose level, electrolyte level, liver function test, erethrocyte sedimentation rate, and a complete blood count. MRI can detect ischemic lesions within minutes, and a CT will rule out cerebral hemorrhage or subdural hematoma. Transcranial doppler ultrasonography provides a rapid identification of the site of arterial occlusion and can identify the form of the embolus.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>Hospitalization. Reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue and the prevention of complications are the main treatment goals. This is accomplished with cardiac monitoring, anticoagulants, and compression stockings for bedridden patients to reduce the risk of <a href="#">deep venous thrombosis</a>.</p>

		</div>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Sudden onset. For a partial anterior circulation infarct, symptoms should include most (but not all) of: dysphasia, visuospatial disturbances, homonymous hemianopia, motor and sensory defects in the face, arm and legs, headache, altered mental status, syncope, seizure or coma.</p>

		<h2>Lacunar Infarct</h2>
		<p> A type of stroke that results from the blocking of one of the penetrating arteries that provides circulation to the brain’s deep structures.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Weakness or paralysis of the face, arm, leg, foot or toes, sudden numbness, difficulty walking or speaking, clumsiness of a hand or arm, eye muscle weakness or paralysis.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>Finding survival rates and prognoses for stroke is tricky since the outcome depends so heavily on exactly where and how severe the occlusion and when treatment was accessed.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>Occlusion of a single penetrating artery leads to lipohyalinosis, a small-vessel brain disease characterised by vessel wall thickening. This leads to the formation of lacunes, small subcortical infarcts.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>Risk factors include hypertension, smoking and diabetes. Lacunar infarcts make up 15-25% of strokes in the US and other Western nations, with an annual incidence of around 13-19 cases per 100,000 population. Men, African Americans, Mexican Americans and Hong Kong Chinese are at higher risk.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>A serum glucose level will rule out hypoglycemia, which can produce similar symptoms. A complete blood cell count is needed to test for <a href="#">thrombocytopenia</a>, which is a contraindication for thrombolysis, the first line treatment. A CT will rule out intracerebral hemorrhage, and may show an old lacune, large cortical stroke or space-occupying lesion, but is usually negative for lacunes in the acute stage. An MRI can identify both acute and old lacunes. An MRA should be performed to see if the lacune is resulting from large-vessel disease, and an ECG can identify potential embolic causes for the lacunes. If severe <a href="#">carotid stenosis</a> is identified, cerebral angiography should also be performed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>Pharmacotherapy includes fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and tissue plasminogen activator. Antiplatelet agents prevent secondary strokes and provide a survival benefit if administered within 48 hours. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevent secondary stroke as well, and anticoagulants prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Gastronomy is occasionally required.</p>

		<h2>Subdural Hematoma</h2>
		<p>A collection of blood and blood breakdown products between the surface of the brain and its outermost meningial covering usually caused by a severe brain injury. May be acute, subacute, or chronic.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Headache, confusion, change in behavior, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, weakness, apathy and seizures.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>In acute subdural hematoma, symptoms usually appear immediately and must be dealt with immediately or severe brain damage will result as pressure increases. If it is subacute, symptoms appear days or weeks after the injury and persist. Chronic hematomas persist much longer and may take weeks to appear.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>Blood vessels, usually veins, rupture between the dura and the brain, usually due to a head injury.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>The elderly, alcoholics, and those who take anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin are at increased risk.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>A CT or MRI is necessary to see the bleed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>For an acute surgical drainage composed of a burr hole (craniotomy) and suction. This may have been the origin of the ancient neurosurgical practice of <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/Trephination/">trepanation</a>. Those with subacute or chronic subdural hematoma may opt out of surgery in favor of monitoring and Vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma to reverse the effects of blood thinners.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="a">
		<h2>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</h2>
		<p>Bleeding into the space between the two inner membranes surrounding the brain.</p>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>A sudden, severe “thunderclap” headache concentrated at the base of the skull. Possible additional symptoms include neck pain, numbness throughout the body, shoulder pain, seizures, confusion, irritability, light sensitivity, vision problems, nausea, vomiting and loss of alertness.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>A subarachnoid hemorrhage is an emergency event with a high risk of death.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>Bleeding from arteriovenous malformation, a bleeding disorder, a cerebral aneurysm, a head injury, or the use of blood thinners.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>People who have had aneurysms, people with connective tissue disorders, high blood pressure, polycystic kidney disease or a history of smoking are at increased risk.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>A physical exam to detect stiff neck, decreased eye movements and a focal neurologic deficit, followed by a head CT, an MRI and cerebral angiography.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>One option is craniotomy and aneurysm clipping. Another is endovascular coiling, in which a surgeon places coils inside the aneurysm and stents in the blood vessel to cage the coils. Medical options include blood pressure management, nimodipine to prevent artery spasms, phenytoin to prevent and treat seizures, and painkillers or antianxiety medication for pressure headaches.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="b">
		<h2>Intracerebral Hemorrhage</h2>
		<p>Bleeding inside the brain, usually caused by the rupture of small, thin-walled arteries passing through the brain tissue.</p>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Sudden unilateral weakness, tingling or paralysis in the face, arm or leg, sudden severe headache, swallowing difficulty, vision problems, coordination difficulty, aphasia, nausea, vomiting, apathy, lethargy, confusion or delirium.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>An acute event requiring extensive medical intervention with a risk of death.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>Arteriovenous malformation, head injury, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, blood thinners, bleeding tumors, cocaine and bleeding disorders can all cause intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>African Americans, Japanese, men, smokers, diabetics, hypertensives, those with heart disease or bleeding disordersand anyone taking blood thinners or cocaine are all at increased risk.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>Neurological exam, CT scan, MRI and angiogram. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>Endovascular embolization, surgical clipping, possible AVM removal, intracranial bypass or stereotactic radiosurgery, depending on the cause. Rehabilitation and therapy is almost always necessary after immediate recovery. </p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="b">
		<h2>Ischemic Stroke</h2>
		<p> A sudden loss or reduction of blood supply to the brain, possibly causing tissue death.</p>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Sudden asymmetrical weakness or numbness in the face, arm or leg, aphasia, loss of vision, strength, coordination, sensation, speech, vision problems, balance problems, vomiting, nausea, fever, hiccups, difficulty swallowing, severe headache followed by loss of consciousness, brief loss of consciousness, sudden falls and dizziness.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>An acute event requiring extensive medical intervention with a risk of death.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>May be caused by thrombosis, in which plaques or atherosclerosis form a clot in the cerebral arteries, or by embolism, in which a blood clot or other debris forms away from the brain, commonly in the heart, and is swept through the bloodstream to lodge in a narrow brain artery.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>85% of strokes are ischemic strokes. Those at increased risk include heavy drinkers, drug users, hypertensives, diabetics, men, smokers, the physically inactive, African Americans, and the obese. A family history of stroke, heart attack or TIA is also a risk factor.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>A diagnosis is made with a physical and neurological examination, a CT or MRI, a blood test for clotting times, blood sugar or infection, an EKG, a cerebral angiogram and a carotid ultrasound.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>Therapy with clot-breaking medication within three hours of onset is essential. This can be immediate aspirin, an IV injection of tissue plasminogen activator, mechanical clot removal, a carotid endarterectomy, or angioplasty and stents. </p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="a">
		<h2>Transient Ischemic Attack</h2>
		<p>A temporary loss of brain function due to an interruption of blood supply to part of the brain.</p>
				<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Sudden asymmetrical visual disturbances, loss of vision, aphasia, confusion, numbness, weakness, paralysis, loss of coordination, dizziness, and possible brief unconsciousness.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>A sudden event with no permanent consequences.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>A clot, possibly caused by atherosclerosis or plaque, blocks the blood supply to the brain momentarily, causing no permanent damage.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>Those with a family history of TIA or stroke, people over 55, African Americans, hypertensives and those with sickle cell disease are at increased risk. Cigarettes, hormonal medication, cocaine, alcohol, and excess dietary fat or sodium can all increase your risk for TIA. Cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, high <a href="#">homocysteine</a> and obesity are also factors.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>A diagnosis of TIA is made with a physical examination, carotid ultrasonography, a CT or MRI, and a CTA or MRA.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>Medical treatment is composed of antiplatelet drugs such as Aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), or dipyridamole (Aggrenox), as well as anticoagulants like heparin (Coumadin) for short term use and warfarin (Jantoven) for long term use. Carotid angioplasty is the surgical course of action.
</p>
		</div>
	</div>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>Brain trauma. Mine happened when I kneed myself in the face in a freak trampolining accident and now I'm not allowed in Jump Street anymore.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>Mostly athletes and children.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">

				<p>A CT or MRI, a skeletal survey, an eye exam, and a blood test to rule out genetic or metabolic disorders.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>Breathing support, appropriate therapy, and surgery to stop any bleeding.</p>

		<h2>Posterior Circulation Infarct</h2>
		<p>A type of stroke affecting the posterior circulation supplying one side of the brain.</p>
			<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Symptoms</h5>
				<p>Vertigo, imbalance, unilateral limb weakness, slurred speech, double vision, headache, nausea, vomiting, gait ataxia, limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Prognosis and Duration</h5>
				<p>Finding survival rates and prognoses for stroke is tricky since the outcome depends so heavily on exactly where and how severe the occlusion and when treatment was accessed.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Cause</h5>
				<p>Causes are varied. They can range from <a href="#">cardiac embolization</a> to intrinsic posterior cerebral artery arathomatous disease, as well as, less commonly, migrainous cerebral infarction, anterior circulation disease, hypercoagulation disorders, drug use, vasculitides and fibromuscular dysplasia. Atheromatous disease or dissection of proximal vessels can cause occlusion or artery to artery embolization, which can travel to the brain and cause PCI. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>Differential diagnosis includes chronic pain syndrome, lacunar stroke, middle cerebral artery stroke, migraine headache, multiple sclerosis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, vascular diseases, vertebrobasilar stroke, basilar artery thrombosis, cardioembolic stroke, <a href="#">dissection syndromes</a>, intracranial hemorrhage, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes, brain metastases, trauma, cardiac embolism, infection, or brainstem infarction. A diagnosis is made with an MRI.

<h5>Demographics</h5>
				<p>5-10% of ischemic strokes in the United States are PCIs. These are more common in men, African Americans, and those with cardiovascular disease. The average age of a PCI sufferer is 61.5 years.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h5>Treatment</h5>
				<p>Hospitalization. Treatment goals mainly revolve around reperfusion of the ischemic brain tissue and the prevention of medical and neurological complications. Cardiac monitoring.</p>
