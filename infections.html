<h2>
This Is Your Brain on Parasites
</h2>
<h3>By Kathleen McAuliffe</h3>
<p>This book taught me that spicy foods are more common in hot countries because their antibacterial properties prevent the meats they season from rotting. It explored how toxoplasmosis makes women more social and men more brooding. It doesn't stick neatly to one theme, and instead jumps around to and from loosely related fun facts like those. A great, light read.</p>

<h2>
Zika: The Emerging Epidemic
</h2>
<h3>By Donald McNeil Jr.</h3>
<p>I didn't include Zika on this page because I did my research before the South American outbreak brought it to prominence, but reading this book made me want to take another look. McNeil, a health journalist, provides an inside look at how the Brazillian crisis unfolded and where it might head.</p>

The Next Pandemic: On the Front Lines Against Humankind's Gravest Dangers
</h2>
<h3>By Dr. Ali S. Khan</h3>
<p>A prominent epidemiologist tells the story of little-known but frightening diseases from rabies to Rift Valley Fever. It very nicely combines anecdotes with history with hard science, and proposes solutions rather than just scaring the reader with a problem.</p>

					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, confusion, hyperactivity, muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, hydrophobia, excessive salivation, hallucinations, insomnia, partial paralysis, tingling and burning at the bite site, certain death.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Rabies immunoglobulin, given in a series of 5 injections over 14 days, can be administered before the onset of symptoms. Possible side effects of rabies immunoglobulin include headache, nausea, stomachache, muscle ache, dizziness and pain, swelling or itching at the injection site.</p>
					<p>After the onset of symptoms, hospice care should be given as the patient will die within a few days</p>

					<h2>Viral Encephalitis</h2>
					<p>Inflammation of the brain caused by a viral infection</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Fever, sore throat, cause, malaise, confusion, disorientation, delusions, and possibly hallucinations, agitation, personality changes, aphasia, paralysis, tremors, seizures, and bulging fontaneslles (in infants).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Duration</h3>
					<p>Incubation periods range from 4-15 days, depending on the cause. The disease usually resolves with treatment within weeks, however untreated encephalitis can take several months to kill.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				
					<h3>Causes</h3>
					<p>Viral encephalitis can becaused by Herpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus 1, Herpes Simplex Virus 2, Epstein-Barr Virus, Varicella-Zoster Virus, or Cytomegalovirus. HSV1 is responsible for most cases of adult herpes encephalitis (5-10% of total encephalitis cases), and tends to be most severe in children and the elderly. HSV2 causes most cases of infant encephalitis, as well as genital herpes.</p>
					<p>Mosquito borne Arboviruses are another common cause. These forms of viral encephalitis include La Crosse, West Nile, St. Louis, Western Equine, Eastern Equine, and Powassan. The incubation period, mortality rate, geographic incidence and high-risk population for a given type of encephalitis varies based on the cause. For instance, St. Louis Encephalitis has a mortality rate between 5 and 30%, whereas Western Equine Encephalitis only kills 3-4% of its victims.</p>
					<p>Adenoviruses such as measles, mumps and rubella, as well as Enterooviruses such as Polio and Coxsackievirus can also cause encephalitis, but these are now rare.</p>
				

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Demographics</h3>
					<p>Adults ages 20-40 are at highest risk for Herpesvirus encephalitis, but young children and the elderly are more vulnerable to every other type.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>CT or MRI to look for swelling or other causes of symptoms, LP to test for presence of virus in the central nervous systems, an EEG and blood or urine test for viruses.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Antiviral drugs: usually Acyclovir (Zovirax), but sometimes Ganciclovir (Cytovene) or Foscarnet (Foscavir). Antiviral treatment is accompanied by bedrest, plenty of fluids, over-the-counter pain medications and anti-inflammatories.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>The Clostridium tetani bacterium, found in soil, dust and animal feces, enters a deep wound and produces spores which secrete a powerful toxin. This toxin, tetanospasmin, impairs the function of the motor neuron.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Duration & Prognosis</h3>

				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Demographics</h3>

					<h2>Post-Polio Syndrome</h2>
					<p>A cluster of disabling symptoms that affect some people several years after contracting polio.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Progressive muscle or joint weakness or pain, general fatigue, muscle atrophy, breathing or swallowing difficulty, sleep-related breathing disorders, sensitivity to cold, cognitive difficulty, depression or mood swings. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>A prior poliovirus infection damages the neurons. In response, the neurons sprout new dendrites, and the surviving motor units become enlarged. The stress of so much new input on only one neuron becomes more than it can handle, so the new fibers and eventually, the entire cell deteriorate.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Prognosis and Duration</h3>
					<p>Post-Polio syndrome is a chronic condition. Onset is at least 15 years after the initial infection.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
					<p>People whose polio infection was especially severe, but who recovered especially quickly are more likely to suffer from post-polio syndrome. A high level of physical activity is also a risk factor.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are done to rule out neuropathy and myopathy. MRIs or CT scans can rule out spinal disorders, spondylosis and spinal stenosis. Following these tests, a muscle biopsy and blood testing will assist in diagnosis of post-polio syndrome.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Treatment is focused on alleviating symptoms. Physical, occupational and speech therapy, as well as lots of rest, can assist in movement difficulties. Medications such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen and aspirin ease muscle and joint pain.</p>

					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
						<p>Headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, cognitive difficulty, decreased movement, changes in personality or vision, drowsiness, confusion, seizures. possible: speech difficulties, vision problems, and limb weakness. In infants, bulging fontanelles, projectile vomiting, high-pitched crying and spasticity in the limbs are often seen.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
						<p>Inflammation (infection) and collection of infected material. Common causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides and Listeria species. Fungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Histoplasma and Blastomyces species, as well as protozoa like T. gondii, E. histolytica, T. cruzi and Schistosoma can also cause abscesses.</p>

					<h3>Demographics</h3>

				</div>

					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
