The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat
</h2>
<h3>Oliver Sacks</h3>
<p>This book has definitely earned its fame. Neurologist/neuroscientist Oliver Sacks retells 24 of the wackiest stories from his private practice-- including a man who mistook his wife for a hat (visual agnosia?) but also autistic twin savants, a "disembodied woman" and a case of drug abuse causing a heightened sense of smell. 10/10.</p>

					<h2>Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
					<p>A progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss and leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Stage 1: Recent memory loss, spatial perception defects, possible: anxiety, depression, and apathy.</p>
					<p>Stage 2: Severe memory loss, confusion, disorientation, concentration difficulties, communication difficulties, aphasia, anxiety, unstable moods, personality changes, and poor judgement.</p>
					<p>Stage 3: Severe confusion, possible: delusions, hallucinations, abnormal reflexes, incontinence, muscular rigidity, diminished movement, difficulty swallowing, difficulty walking, and difficulty speaking.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p> A wide range of medications are avaliable to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as Donepezil (Aricept), Galantamine (Razadyne), and Rivastigmine (Exelon), can improve neuropsychiatric symptoms. The side effects of these drugs incllude diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, sleep disturbances, and bradycardia in those with cardiac connection problems. Another drug, Memantine (Namenda), slows the progression of symptoms in moderate to severe AD, but can cause constipation, dizziness and headache.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Prognosis</h3>
					<p>The average life expectancy after diagnosis is 8-10 years, but can vary from 3-20.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
					<p>The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease doubles every 5 years after age 65, and almost exclusively affects individuals age 60 and older. Other risk factors include </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Incidence</h3>
					<p>Alzheimer's disease affects a total of 5.1 million Americans and makes up 62% of dementia cases worldwide.</p>
				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Alzheimer's disease is a diagnosis of exclusion. Mental status testing, a psychological evaluation for depression, and lab tests for thyroid problems and thiamine deficiency must be done. CT and MRIs, blood tests, and physical exams can point to Alzheimer's, but only a posthumous examination can definitively diagnose.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>Over time, beta-amyloid protein plaques accumulate outside neurons in the brain, while tau protein tangles form inside neurons. Gradually, the affected cells lose the ability to communicate with one another and die. This process primarily affects the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex, all of which shrink drastically, causing the symptoms.</p>

					<h2>Lewy Body Dementia</h2>
					<p>Protein deposits in neurons that control cognition, memory and motor control cause progressive degeneration of the brain and a decline in mental abilities.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-2">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>The abnormal accumulation of alpha synuclein protein causes degeneration of neurons in the cortex.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Early: Sleep disturbances, vivid visual hallucinations (objects, people or animals), slowness, gait imbalance and visuospatial impairment.</p>
					<p>Overall: Cognitive difficulty, confusion, reduced attention span, memory loss (eventual and less significant), depression, disordered: blood pressure, pulse, sweating, and digestion.</p>
					<p>Possible: Significant fluctuations in attention, daytime drowsiness, staring into space, muscle rigidity, tremors, slowed movement, shuffling walk, dizziness, falls and bowel issues</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-2">
					<h3>Prognosis</h3>
					<p>The average life expectancy after the onset of symptoms is 5-7 years. Death usually occurs from pneumonia or other infections.</p>
				</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
					<p>Men are more likely than women to develop Lewy Body Dementia, most commonly between the ages of 70 and 79. LBD tends to affect individuals at a younger age than Parkinson's, which can be important in reaching a differential diagnosis.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>CT, MRI, blood tests and physical and neurological examination can all be helpful in diagnosing LBD. Patient and family interviews are used as well to determine the nature of behavioral changes.</p>
				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="row">

					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms, not fixing the root problem.</p>
					<p>Cholinesterase inhibitors: increase neurotransmitters that are important for memory, thought and judgement in the brain. Improve alertness and cognition, reduce hallucinations and adverse behaviors. The most common cholinesterase inhibitor is Rivastigmine (Exelon), whose side effects include gastrointestinal distress, excessive salivation, excessive tearing, and frequent urination.</p>
					<p>Antipsychotics such as Quetiapine (Seroquel) Olanzapine (Zyprexa) reduce delusions and hallucinations. In some sensitive patients, these drugs can cause severe parkinsonian symptoms and confusion.</p>
					<p> Parkinson's Disease Medications like Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet) reduce muscle rigidity and slow movement. Side effects of Carbidopa-Levodopa are confusion, hallucinations and delusions.</p>

					<h2>Mixed Dementia</h2>
					<p>A degeneration of the brain with more than one cause.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Possible: memory loss, anxiety, depression, apathy, confusion, disorientation, concentration difficulties, communication difficulties, aphasia, unstable moods, personality changes, poor judgement, possible: delusions, hallucinations, abnormal reflexes, incontinence, muscular rigidity, diminished movement, difficulty swallowing, difficulty walking, difficulty speaking, Sleep disturbances, gait imbalance, visuospatial impairment, Cognitive difficulty, reduced attention span, disordered: blood pressure, pulse, sweating, digestion, daytime drowsiness, staring into space, muscle rigidity, tremors, slowed movement, shuffling walk, dizziness, falls, and bowel issues.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Cholinesterase inhibitors improve neuropsychiatric symptoms and Memantine slows the progression of symptoms for an underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease. Antipsychotics and Parkinson's disease medications treat an underlying cause of Lewy Body dementia. The underlying cause of vascular dementia is treated with blood pressure and cholesterol medication, and blood thinners. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-2">
					<h3>Prognosis</h3>
					<p>The prognosis depends on the underlying cause.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
					<p>The risk for mixed dementia, like all forms of dementia, is more common in older populations.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Brain scans, blood tests, physical exams, mental status testing, and patient and family interviews are all helpful in finding the underlying causes. However, mixed dementia can only be definitively diagnosed by a brain autopsy.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>Most commonly Alzheimer’s combined with vascular dementia, followed by Alzheimer’s with Lewy body dementia.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Medical history, neurological examination, family and friend interviews
MRI, looking for evidence of a recent stroke or other blood vessel changes whose severity and location are consistent with the patient’s neurocognitive impairment.
</p>

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12">
						 <h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Blood pressure and cholesterol medication, blood thinners, and blood sugar medication (if diabetes is a contributing factor) can all be used to control the underlying vascular condition. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as Donepezil (Aricept), Galantamine (Razadyne), and Rivastigmine (Exelon) improve neuropsychiatric symptoms. The side effects of these drugs are nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and diarrhea.

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p> Early stage: inappropriate behavior, personality changes, loss of interpersonal skills, impaired judgement, apathy, compulsive behavior, changes in eating habits, and lack of awareness of changes.
					Late stage: mutism, hyperorality, akinesia, unresponsiveness to verbal commands, and possible memory loss.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Antidepressants such as Trazodone (Oleptro) and SSRIs control behavioral problems. Antipsychotics such as Olanzapine (Zyprexa) and Quetiapine (Seroquel) reduce behavioral problems as well. Side effects include increased risk of mortality in older people. </p>

			<div class="row">
				
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p> Resting tremor, bradykinesia, shuffling gait, muscle rigidity, impaired balance, stooped posture, loss of automatic movements, and speech impairment. During stage 1, symptoms are mild and affect only one side of the body. At stage 2, symptoms are mild on both sides of the body. Stage 3 symptoms are mild to moderate and include impaired balance. By stage 4, symptoms are severe and the patient cannot function independently. Stage 5 leaves the patient wheelchair-bound or bedridden without assistance. Eventually, the disease can progress to dementia.</p>

					<h3>Prognosis</h3>
					<p>Parkinson's disease is chronic but not fatal. However, it can complicate into fatality with falls, pneumonia and choking.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
					<p>Parkinson's disease is more common in men than in women. The average age of onset is 60, but some people are diagnosed as early as 40.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>A neurological exam and patient history can diagnose Parkinson's disease.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>Alpha-synuclein protein aggregates form in the substantia nigra, causing degeneration of dopamine-producing cells.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h3>Treatment</h3>
				<p>There is an extremely wide variety of medication avaliable to treat Parkinson's Disease.</p>
				<p>Carbidopa-Levodopa (Levodopa and Rytary or Sinemet, or Duopa) is the most effective regimen. Levodopa is converted into dopamine, and Carbidopa prevents Levodopa from converting prematurely outside the blood-brain barrier. It can either be given orally or through a feeding tube in a gel form to the small intestine, which is better for patients with advanced disease that has caused fluctuations in their response. The side effects include dyskinesia, nausea, lightheadedness and tolerance. When infused, the side effects include the tube falling out and infections can occur at the infusion site.</p>
				<p>Dopamine agonists are drugs that mimic dopamine effects in the brain. They are not as effective as Levodopa in treating the symptoms, but they last longer and are often prescribed with levodopa. Pramipexole (Mirapex), Ropinrole (Requip), Rotigotine (Neupro patch), and Apomorphine (Apokyn short-acting injection) are all common dopamine agonists. Their side effects include hallucinations, sleepiness and compulsive behaviors such as hypersexuality, gambling and eating.</p>
				<p>MAO-B inhibitors (monoamine oxidase B inhibitor): prevent the breakdown of dopamine by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase B. Common drugs in this class include Selegilline (Eldepryl, Zelapar) and Rasagiline (Azilect). Side effects include nausea, insomnia and hallucinations when used in combination with carbidopa-levodopa. They should not be used in combination with antidepressants or certain narcotics.</p>
				<p>Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors like Entacapone (Comtan) mildly prolong the effect of levodopa therapy by blocking the COMT enzyme that breaks down dopamine. Side effects of COMT inhibitors include dyskinesias, diarrhea and levodopa side effects.</p>
				<p>The anticholinergic drugs Benztropine (Cogentin) and Trihexyphenidyl control tremors. The side effects of these drugs include impaired memory, confusion, hallucinations, dry mouth, constipation and impaired urination.</p>
				<p>Amantadine: prescribed alone to provide short-term relief of mild, early-stage Parkinson’s, or later on with carbidopa-levodopa therapy for dyskinesias
				Side effects of Amantadine include ankle swelling, purple mottled skin, hallucinations.</p>
				<p>Deep brain stimulation: a surgical implantation of electrodes into a specific part of the brain to stabilize medication fluctuations, reduce dyskinesias, slowing of movement, tremors and rigidity.</p>

					<h2>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy</h2>
					<p>A progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in those with a history of repetitive brain trauma, both symptomatic concussions and subconcussive trauma to the head.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				
					<h3>Symptoms</h3>
					<p>Over the entire course of the illness, symptoms can include short-term memory loss, cognitive impairment, confusion, impaired judgement, aggression, depression, anxiety, apathy, suicidality, parkinsonism, dementia, emotional instability, substance abuse, impulsivity, difficulty planning, Possible later: irritability, speech difficulties, language difficulties, motor impairment, trouble swallowing, vision problems, and olfactory problems.
					Stage I is limited to headache, loss of attention and concentration. By stage II, depression, explosivity and short term memory loss are common. 
					Stage III decision-making dysfunction and cognitive impairment
					Stage IV: Dementia, word-finding difficulty and aggression</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Prognosis</h3>
					<p>Symptoms usually begin 8-10 years after repetitive MBTI and progress until death.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
					<p>Repetitive head trauma is the sole known contributing factor. This most commonly affects athletes, especially football and soccer players, and military personnel.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
					<p>Autopsy is the only definitive test. Neurological examination, MRI, PET scans, and EEGs can assist in a diagnosis while the patient is alive.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Cause</h3>
					<p>Repetitive head trauma injures neurons. Tau proteins and TDP-43 are deposited in the brain abnormally in an attempt to heal, and end up choking and killing neurons. White matter also changes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Treatment</h3>
					<p>Because chronic traumatic encephalopathy is relatively new to the DSM, there is currently no approved drug to treat it.</p>
